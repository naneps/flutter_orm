# Flutter ORM for SQLite

A simple and powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution for Flutter with SQLite support. This package allows you to interact with your SQLite database using an elegant model-based approach, similar to Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

## Features

- **Automatic Migrations**: Automatically manage your database schema with migrations.
- **Table Creation**: Automatically create tables based on model definitions.
- **Model Generation**: Generate models that correspond to database tables.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform basic create, read, update, and delete operations on your SQLite database through models.
- **Query Builder**: Build complex queries using a fluent API.
- **Relationships**: Support for defining relationships between models (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>= 3.0)
- SQLite Database

### Installation
To use this package, add it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_orm: ^1.0.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

### Setup
First, initialize the database:

```dart
import 'package:your_package_name/your_package_name.dart';

void main() {
  final database = Database();
  database.initialize();
}
```

## Usage

### Define a Model
Create a model class to represent a table in your SQLite database:

```dart
class User extends Model {
  @primaryKey
  final int id;
  final String name;
  final int age;

  User({required this.id, required this.name, required this.age});

  // Define table name
  @override
  String get tableName => 'users';

  // Define relationships
  static belongsTo(Post post) => BelongsTo(post);
}
```

### Create and Retrieve Data
Create and retrieve data using your model:

```dart
void createUser() async {
  final user = User(id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 30);
  await user.save();
}

void getUser() async {
  final user = await User.find(1);
  print(user.name);
}
```

### Automatic Migrations
Run migrations to create or update your tables based on model changes:

```dart
void migrate() async {
  await Database.migrate();
}
```
